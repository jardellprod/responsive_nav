# RESPONSIVE NAV

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was for me to do daily practice of Javascript, focus on mastering the basics. I am using the following web page to get my challenges: [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/#heading-how-to-create-a-responsive-navbar)

My main focus was finding efficient ways to do the animation displayed.

## Things Learned

- Used the toggle method to switch between states. This came in handy when determining if the hamburger menu had a class passed to it or not.

- Using classList methods to add and remove classes.

- Not JS related, but I learned about CSS transition and how to manipulate specific properties and their transition capabilities.

- Also learned a bit more about SVG tags and how to use them.

## Summary

In the end I took a simple approach to the project. Rather than having each incrementation of the nav-links be the height of a single list, I instead added a max-height property for the transition and had it happen slowly. Reason, this requires less Javascript, and has a smoother feel to the page. Sometimes simple is best.
